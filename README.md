# Note
Risitas development has stopped due to the fact that discord.py is no longer being maintained. You will be able to find a discord.js version of risitas [here](https://github.com/hbombofficial/risitas-discordjs) once it is avaliable. The current discord support server will eventually become the support server for the risitas discord.js version.
