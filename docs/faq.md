# Risitas FAQ

Q: Why can't I use .env? A: Python seems to give an `ImportError` when trying to load `load_dotenv`, which is the package that would load data from a .env file. 

Q: Are there any dependencies other than python? A: No, the only packages you need to run Risitas are [Python](https://python.org/downloads/) and discord.py

Q: How do I create a bot in the Discord Developer Portal? A: This [YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/b61kcgfOm_4?t=35) should help. If you require further assistance, join the [Discord Support Server](https://discord.gg/daVywQMDam)

Q: Which Discord permissions will the bot need? A: I would recommend giving the bot administrator, as some commands may require those permissions.

Q: How do I move my bot's role in the hierarchy? A: [Instructions](docs/hierarchy.md)
