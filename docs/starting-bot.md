## Starting the bot

If you haven't already, install the required packages listed in [Dependencies](docs/dependencies.md)

1. Create a bot in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/)
2. Paste your bot's token in the `token.txt` file. Please note that `token.txt` must be in the same directory as `bot.py`
3. Run the command `python (path to file)` in a terminal. (ex. `python C:\Users\hbomb\discord-bots\risitas\bot.py`)
4. Move your bot's role up in the hierarchy. [Hierarchy Instructions](docs/hierarchy.md)
